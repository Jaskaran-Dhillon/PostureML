# PostureML- HTN 2021 Submission

## What it does
PostureML uses machine learning to determine the type of posture that the user is in. It sends reminders to the user whenever it detects that the user is in a malicious posture and reminds them of their posture, and how to fix it. The user will be able to choose the type of reminder and their interface. Finally, there will be another section to the website, where the user can view their statistics on a graph, knowing which malicious postures they have done the most.

## How we built it

We used React to build the frontend of the website, and used Javascript to build the backend of the project. For machine learning, we used the Microsoft Azure API.

## Next Steps

PostureML has room for technical improvements. This includes additional classifications for different kinds of malicious posture, and even pre-detecting medical conditions such as scoliosis and lumbar lordosis. Additional classifications for the user to fix their posture, as well as additional functionalities such as recommending to see a physician would be integrated into future versions of PostureML.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
