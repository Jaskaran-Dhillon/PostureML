# PostureML- HTN 2021 Submission

## What it does
PostureML uses machine learning to determine the type of posture that the user is in. It sends reminders to the user whenever it detects that the user is in a malicious posture and reminds them of their posture, and how to fix it. The user will be able to choose the type of reminder and their interface. Finally, there will be another section to the website, where the user can view their statistics on a graph, knowing which malicious postures they have done the most.

## How we built it

We used React to build the frontend of the website, and used Javascript to build the backend of the project. For machine learning, we used the Microsoft Azure API.

## Next Steps

PostureML has room for technical improvements. This includes additional classifications for different kinds of malicious posture, and even pre-detecting medical conditions such as scoliosis and lumbar lordosis. Additional classifications for the user to fix their posture, as well as additional functionalities such as recommending to see a physician would be integrated into future versions of PostureML.
